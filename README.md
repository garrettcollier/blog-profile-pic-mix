# Categorical To-Do

An organized to-do list.

## Purpose

The Categorical To-Do list is intended to help its users more easily organize their tasks by allowing users to sort their tasks into custom categories. The app is intended for anyone who feels that their to-do list needs a little more organization. There is even a percentage based progress indicator for each category to make it easier to check how close you are to done!

## Usage

Using the app is quite simple! Just press the floating action button to add and new category and its first task all at once.

As you can see, the percentage indicator tells the percentage of tasks that have been completed. If all the tasks have been completed or deleted the category can be deleted by tapping and holding on the + button next to the category name.
